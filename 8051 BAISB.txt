8051 BASIC COMPONENTS:
* 4k byte internal rom
* 128 byte internal ram
* four 8 bit i/o ports (p0-p3)
* two 16 bit timers/counters
* one serial interface 

other 8051 fectures
* only 1 on chip oscillator (external crystal)
* 6 interrupt sources (2 external, 3 internal, reset)
* 64 external code (program) memory(only read)PSEN
* 64 external data memory (can be read and write)by RD,WR
* code memory is selectable by EA (internal and external)
* we may have external memoty as data and code

              IMPORTANT PINS (IO PORTS)
* one of the most useful features af the 8051 is that it contains four i/o ports

* port 0 (pins 32-39):p0(p0.0-p0.7)
  * 8 bit R/W general purpose I/O
  * "or" acts as a multiplexed low byte address and data bus for external memory design

* port 1 (pin 1-8) p1(p1.0-p1.7)
  *only 8 bit R/W general purpose I/O
  
* port 2(pin 21-28) p2(p2.0-p2.7)
  *only 8 bit R/W general purpose I/O
  *"or high" byte of the address bus for external memory design

* port 3 (pin 10-17) p3(p3.0-p3.7)
  *general purpose I/O
  *if not used any of the internal peripherals (timers)or external interrupts

*EACT PORT CAN BE USED AS INPUT AND OUTPUT (BIDRECTIONAL)
